# Planner

This is a simple planner that allows you to make plans depending on the time, and save them for later.
I was able to get the page to be saved, but had a lot of difficulty with the time/color change part of the project and wasn't able to successfully do it.

The hardest part of this project was using Jquery correctly due to the radically different syntax. It was fairly overwhelming, but I thought it was extremely useful in actually generating the page layout, as it offered a certain degree of automation, so I can totally see the use for it in the grand scheme of things.
